## Meta-Abstract
This is an attempt at [README first development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html), & not all the features are implemented.

## Abstract
Programmer fonts is a site which aims to make it as easy, quick & pleasant as
possible for programmers to select mono spaced fonts for development. 

## Features
* The site presents a comprehensive list of fonts so the site can be a
one-stop-shop.
* It allows downloading of these fonts.
* Users can preview fonts with various programming languages.
* Users can preview fonts with their choice of editor colour scheme.
* The site attempts to be ascetically pleasing, especially with respect to typography.
* The site is designed to avoid distracting the user from viewing and assessing fonts.
* Popular fonts are presented first to speed selection in some cases. Users
are able to decide what is "popular".
* There might be a mechanism for feedback / feature requests in the future.
